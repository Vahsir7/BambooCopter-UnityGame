## About the game

The game is inspired from flappy bird, a famous game. The game is about a bird which is flying through bamboo sticks. The player has to control the copter to avoid the bamboo sticks. The game is endless and the player has to survive as long as possible.

My game is similar just the player is doraemon who avoids construction poles instead of bamboo sticks.
Each avoidance gives you a score and when you hit the pole a life deducts. The game ends when you have no lives left.
